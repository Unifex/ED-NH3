# Explorers Needed for Ammonia World Survey
This is a tool for players of [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) that are participating in the [Ammonia World Survey 2](https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/64007617ff30130adf4d10a9) community goal.

## Credits
* The map is provided by [ED3D](https://github.com/gbiobob/ED3D-Galaxy-Map). It's old, a bit out of date, but works very well.
* The list of systems and bodies is from the list on [Inara](https://inara.cz/elite/nearest-bodies/?ps1=Eta+Cassiopeiae&pi32=51&pi30=0&formbrief=1)
* The coordinates were fetched from the [EDSM](https://www.edsm.net/) API.
